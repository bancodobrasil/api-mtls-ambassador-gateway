# API mTLS Ambassador Gateway (client)

Ambassador Docker container used to authenticate using mTLS for the Open Banking and PIX API communication as client (request)

## Quick Start

First, bring up the [mTLS API server sidecar example](https://github.com/bancodobrasil/api-mtls-sidecar-server).

Now, to use this Ambassador to connect to this service using mTLS, open your terminal and:

```bash

git clone https://github.com/bancodobrasil/api-mtls-ambassador-client.git

```

```bash

docker-compose up

```

Then run `curl`:

```bash
$ curl http://localhost:9090
{"data":"I'm a GET secured by an mTLS!"}
```

## The whole pattern

The full pattern implemented here is the sidecar-proxy and ambassador-gateway. You can [check here](https://github.com/bancodobrasil/api-mtls-ambassador-gateway) the ambassador-gateway part.

## Bundling certificates in a Docker imagem

In the [example folder](/example) you have some instructions on how to build this ambassador bundling your certificates. Basically, you will create a Dockerfile with the following contents:

```Dockerfile
FROM bancodobrasil/api-mtls-ambassdor-gateway:0.1.0

COPY local/path/to/client.cert.pem /etc/nginx/conf.d/certs/client.cert.pem
COPY local/path/to/client.key.pem /etc/nginx/conf.d/certs/client.key.pem
COPY local/path/to/trusted_ca_cert.pem /etc/nginx/conf.d/certs/trusted_ca_cert.pem
```

This way you won't need to map any volume or define environment var. The container will be built specifically for one given client.
